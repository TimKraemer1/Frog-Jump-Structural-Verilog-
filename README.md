# Frog Jump – Digital Logic Design Project (Structural Verilog)

This project is a hardware implementation of the classic **Frog Jump** game using **Structural Verilog**, designed for display on a **VGA monitor**.

The game features a playable frog character that moves across the screen with user input, rendered in real-time using a **custom RGB graphics driver**.
